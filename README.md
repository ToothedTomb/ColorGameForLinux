# Color Game For Linux.
About game:
You need to pick what colour the text is but be warned the text will say a different colour and may trick you! Do you have what it takes to get 100 points in 90 seconds? 
Note: This game is free and open-source!
Note: I am just experimenting snaps. So please ignore the .yaml file.
